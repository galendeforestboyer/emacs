FEEDBACK OF EMPLOYEE OR POSTDOC
In this section employees/postdocs should recommend 2-5 input providers. These should be individuals who worked closely with you (the employee/postdoc) over the past year and can speak to that experience. The input providers can be part of your direct team or outside of your lab/group/platform. Managers should contact those individuals and use this section to summarize feedback collected along with their own input
