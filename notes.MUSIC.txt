CAGED is 5 letters, all defining the names of chords.
Caged is this:
Draw the C-Chord. All chords are defined by the note on the lowest string in the chord. The C-Chord is defined by its lowest note found on the A-String, which is a C. Okay, the next shape is the second letter in the word CAGED, A. The A shape is also defined by the lowest note found on the A-String. In this case, the note on the 3rd fret of the A-string is a C. So, bar at the 3rd fret (ie, where the C-Chord ended) and create the A-Shape. That is also a C-Chord. At this point, you have now connected 5 frets with two chord shapes, all in the Key of C. Those 2 shapes are the 1st two letters in CAGED. Next, letter in CAGED is G. Well, the G-Chord is defined by the note on the low-E-String. The A-Shape ended on the 5th fret. If you bar that 5th fret and create the G-Shape, the note on the low-E-string is a C, so now you have the third chord in CAGED (BTW, this shape is almost impossible to actually make). You have now connected 8 frets using three shapes all keeping you in the key of C. You have E and D to go.
To really see this, instead of barring, use a capo to walk up the fretboard.
As long as you know what string defines the chord names, you can use CAGED to climb out the fretboard keeping yourself in the same key.
